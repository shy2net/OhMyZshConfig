## Introduction

This is my installation and configurations of oh-my-zsh for Mac. Calling the install.sh script will
install oh-my-zsh with iTerm2.

It includes the following:

- iTerm 2
- oh-my-zsh
- Meslo font
- Powerlevel9k

Simply call:
> ./install.sh

This installation is based on [This Oh-My-Zsh gist](https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070).
